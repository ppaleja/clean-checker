    "description": "A simple tool that allows you to check if a song is clean. Uses the Happi API. Loosely based on the weather app from Fullstack React Native by Devin Abbott.\n\nVersion a1.0\n\nCurrent Functionality:\n  - Search a song, and the app will check if it is clean, how many swear words it has, and what percentage of the \n     song is swearwords\nFuture Functionality:\n  - Better rating algorithm (more helpful)\n  - Prettier UX"
